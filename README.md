PatikaAcademy Back-End for beginners course Zoo Management System UML


You are designing a system to track information about animals in a zoo.

Animals:
Horses (horses, zebras, donkeys, etc.),
Felines (tigers, lions, etc.),
It is characterized by species in groups such as rodents (rats, beavers, etc.).
Most of the information stored about animals is the same for all groupings.
species name, weight, age, etc.
The system should also be able to get the dosage of specific drugs for each animal => getDosage()
System should be able to calculate Feed timings => getFeedSchedule()
The logic by which the system performs these functions will be different for each grouping. For example, the feeding algorithm is different for horses and will be different for tigers.

Using the polymorphism model, design a class diagram to handle the situation described above.
